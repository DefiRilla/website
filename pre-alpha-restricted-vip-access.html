            <h2>What this landing page is for</h2>

            <br/>
            This is a personal project currently provided 100% free of charge to a select audience to setup <b>realtime wallet DeFi notification alerts</b> for one wallet each for the sole purpose of gathering feedback if it provides any value?
            <br/>
            </br>

            IMPORTANT: This service is working but is pre-beta: it is <b>not publically released, not finished, may not be accurate and <em class="highlight">does not request or accept any kind of payment and does not request or accept any kind of wallet connection</em></b>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This landing page is <b>only</b> designed to:
            <ul>
                <ol>1) list the types of <b>DeFi yield wallet monitoring notifications</b></ol>
                <br/>
                <ol>2) show <b>examples of <a href=#alerts>real alerts</a></b> just sent to other experts</b></ol>
                <br/>
                <ol>3) allow you to automatically <b>monitor via alerts all your wallet's DeFi yield positions by either email or telegram</b><br/>(via just your <b>public wallet address</b> and for <b>free</b>)</ol>
            </ul>


            <br/><br/><hr/><br/>


            <h1>Setup DeFi monitoring alerts on your wallet</h1>

            It just takes <b>5 seconds</b> to start monitoring your own/anyone's* EVM wallet's DeFi positions (no signup, no wallet connection, no wallet signing) - just choose how you'd like to receive notification alerts:

            <br/><br/><small>Please only setup alerts on your main best wallet with most DeFi yield positions as our servers cannot scale at this time
            <br/>If you do want to monitor more than one wallet, please just contact us first (support {AT} defirilla.com) so we can scale our servers for you if required</small>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>

            I started this personal project three years ago after getting badly liquidated and my remaining crypto was returned to me converted into stable coins.
            
            <br/><br/>I did not notice for weeks.

            <br/><br/>Unfortunately, when I did notice the crypto market had pumped considerably, and I was only able to convert the returned stable coins into a tiny fraction of my original crypto.

            <br/><br/>The DeFi site had no kind of monitoring or alerting system.

            <br/><br/>The final straw was when Aave removed their health notification system, I knew I had to find a DeFi monitoring solution.

            <br/><br/>I tried every existing "monitoring" and "alert" system but none provided the health factor alerts I required across ALL DeFi yield protocols.

            <br/><br/>So I set out on a personal project to build realtime notification alerts for myself.

            <br/><br/>It turned out to be much more complicated than I anticipated to autodetect and support all DeFi sites across all EVM chains and provide realtime alerts on their health factors.

            <br/><br/>But I finally managed it.
            
            <br/><br/>It was then relatively trivial to add a whole range of different alerts which save me time and effort including real reward, borrow & supply APRs, when my DeFi limit orders hit, and more recently alerts when my LPs exit range.

            <br/><br/>When describing the platform to my non crypto mentors, as there is nothing like it, they recommend I seek feedback from other crypto DeFi yield experts if it also adds value to them and is worth developing into a Startup.

            <br/><br/>And here we are today.
            
            <br/><br/>I am currently working on it full time to keep it up, resolve bugs and implement requested features.
            
            <br/><br/><b>I appreciate you being early and also your time, patience and expertise</b>.
