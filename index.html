            <h2>Motivation</h2>

            I started this personal project three years ago after getting badly liquidated and my remaining crypto was returned to me converted into stable coins.
            
            <br/><br/>I did not notice for weeks.

            <br/><br/>Unfortunately, when I did notice the crypto market had pumped considerably, and I was only able to convert the returned stable coins into a tiny fraction of my original crypto.

            <br/><br/>The DeFi site had no kind of monitoring or alerting system.

            <br/><br/>The final straw was when Aave removed their health notification system, I knew I had to find a DeFi monitoring solution.

            <br/><br/>I tried every existing "monitoring" and "alert" system but none provided the health factor alerts I required across ALL DeFi yield protocols.

            <br/><br/>So I set out on a personal project to build realtime notification alerts for myself.

            <br/><br/>It turned out to be much more complicated than I anticipated to autodetect and support all DeFi sites across all EVM chains and provide realtime alerts on their health factors.

            <br/><br/>But I finally managed it.
            
            <br/><br/>It was then relatively trivial to add a whole range of different alerts which save me time and effort including real reward, borrow & supply APRs, when my DeFi limit orders hit, and more recently alerts when my LPs exit range.

            <br/><br/>When describing the platform to my non crypto mentors, as there is nothing like it, they recommend I seek feedback from other crypto DeFi yield experts if it also adds value to them and is worth developing into a Startup.

            <br/><br/>And here we are today.
            
            <br/><br/>I am currently working on it full time to keep it up, resolve bugs and implement requested features.
            
            <br/><br/><b>I appreciate you being early and also your time, patience and expertise</b>.
